Finally got around to putting up a website for project thor - my senior project. I have a setup on the CS department server (I used webgen for it) but this is going to be more long term thing. This one is generated using jekyll, a ruby-based static website generation engine and hosted on github. I'll be posting things I find out about Clojure, wireless networking and to document things that may not quite fit into the wiki.

Currently the project is on a private repository on my [github account](http://github.com/prasincs). 

Wish Me Luck.
