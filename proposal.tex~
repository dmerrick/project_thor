\section*{Introduction}
In an age where decentralization and parallelization are the key, distributed hash tables (DHTs) have had revolutionary effects. In essence, a DHT is a system designed to harness the storage and network resources of large number of computers by providing a hash-table interface where the \emph{(key,value)} pairs are stored across various nodes; where \emph{keys} are hashes of the objects or \emph{values} stored in the system \cite{Naor07novelarchitectures}. Some of the most common uses, apart from academic research projects have been in peer-to-peer file transfer protocols like Bittorrent's distributed tracker where nodes can be distributed anywhere in the internet and can drop in and out of connection. More recently, projects like Cassandra, Bigtable have emerged to provide structured storage systems using DHTs \cite{Chang06bigtable:a}\cite{Lakshman_cassandra-a}. A parallel in the wireless networks of this type of communication is mobile ad-hoc networking (MANET) where the communicating nodes do not rely on preexisting infrastructures such as routers or access points to communicate with each other. Instead, each node routes by forwarding data to other nodes. My project aims to explore the use of DHTs on adhoc networks to answer questions about the practicality, reliability, integrity and consistency in such networks. From experience I know that testing and measuring adhoc in the field is difficult at best, so I want to leverage the existing network simulation frameworks like NS-2/NS-3, OPNET, GloMoSim, NetSim to accurately model DHTs on ad-hoc networks and creating my own simulation environment that will augment the existing simulation infrastructure or if needed, be entirely new based on the requirements of the project.
%% You probably want to talk about what those existing implementations are.  
%% I know you are comparing it against the current POSIT infrastructure, but
%% you should be a little more clear. Perhaps this is not important and you
%% are simply investigating the practicality of DHTs on adhoc networks in
%% a variety of circumstances.  In other words, you are looking to see if
%% using DHTs on Adhoc networks are useful at all.

\section*{Description}
A DHT layer shields many difficult issues including fault-tolerance, locating object, scalability, availability, load balancing for distributed application designer\cite{Saumitra04howto}. Existing algorithms like ``consistent hashing`` implemented in DHTs have been proven to be fault tolerant and able to adapt to changing network topologies by efficiently partitioning a keyspace among distributed set of nodes and provide an additional overlay network which connects nodes such that the node responsible for any key can be efficiently located\cite{consistentHashing}. Various options have been explored to implement DHTs in MANETs using a proximity-aware DHT Pastry\cite{Rowstron01pastry:scalable} and on-demand MANET routing protocol DSR\cite{Johnson02dynamicsource}. Based on my experience working on the Random Walk Gossip algorithm implementation on POSIT\cite{positRWG}, I have realized that testing mobile ad-hoc networks consistently in the field can be very challenging without a detailed test simulation to base it on. My goal is to design a simulator for experimenting with DHTs on Ad-hoc networks, exploring network topologies and power consumption in the devices communicating. That said, I will be exploring and understanding various existing simulation frameworks to come up with a workable model to run my tests. The most important questions I aim to explore and answer are:
\begin{itemize}
 \item How power efficient can DHT on Adhoc network be?
 \item What kinds of network topologies are preferrable?
 \item What are the effects of adding or removing nodes on the network?
 \item How do you deal with network partition?
\end{itemize}
The simulator I want to work on would be written in clojure, a lisp dialect running on the java JVM. My main motivation is that given that I have a rather short time frame of a year to complete this project, I want to be able to test the various components of the applications as independent of each other as possible. Using a functional language makes it much easier to do as I can test individual functions separately. I can also use various existing Java and C libraries when needed and simulate code that's much closer to the actual system's code. The architectures I'll be looking primarily would be Android phones- the ADP1 and the Nexus one and ad-hoc network implementations in Linux in laptops. I'll run a battery drain test on my targets with various stress levels to get an idea of the network usage with respect to power for the phones and run the simulations around those parameters.
The end result of this project would be a simulator that does the network simulation that lets us create DHTs on a random number of nodes, observe progress on each node and report and record the results. The variables that are relevant are - loss of data when a certain percentage of nodes drop, power consumption on average of each of the algorithms, throughput of the network, availability of a key/value pair on a network over time. Along with this, I want to explore these conditions in various network topologies and network conditions.
%% Ok.  At this point it seems clear that you have two foci:
%%   1) Researching existing network simulation environments for adhoc networks
%%      and possibly implementing your own.
%%   2) Researching DHTs on Adhoc networks using your simulation
%%      environment.

%% Is this correct?  If so, I would restate your introduction to indicate that
%% testing and measuring ad-hoc networks is difficult at best and that you aim
%% to either (a) leverage an existing simulation framework to accurately model
%% and evaluate a ad-hoc network based on the criteria you metion above, or
%% (2) create your own simulation environment that will augment an existing
%% simulation infrastructure or be entirely new.

\section*{Timetable}
\begin{itemize}
 \item End of September - Finish research on frameworks, relevant papers, required devices, libraries
 \item 15th October - Get data about the phones being tested
 \item 22nd October - Finish preliminary architecture of the simulator
 \item 29th October - Report on existing frameworks 
 \item 12th November - Technical Paper Presentation
 \item 7th December - Prototype of the simulator for implementing basic DHT network on simulated ad-hoc networks
 \item 15th December - Project report and findings from the semester
\end{itemize}

\section*{Budget}
I'll need two or more laptops/netbooks that I can create ad-hoc networks on and get real data that I need for the project. Also since adhoc networks on laptops is much better understood, that'd let me benchmark and test against existing ad-hoc network implementations. Since books on this topic are rather sparse in the library, I'd like to order a few books too. Most of the network simulators I've mentioned are either open source or free under academic license but getting software might be necessary.

\section*{Conclusion}
With this project I'm aiming to get a better understanding of the state of Distributed Hash Tables on Adhoc networks and test the practicality of those networks. I'll also learn about running network simulation and testing hypotheses about various DHTs on Adhoc network implementations with them. In the end, I want to have a working simulator to test and observe various network conditions by simulating real network hardware and conditions as well as possible.
